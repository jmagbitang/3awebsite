            <p>As a designer for BlueDot Inc. in the summer of 2016, I designed for their upcoming suite of consumer applications focused on international travel, infectious diseases, and diagnostic tools.
            Currently, BlueDot has their first consumer app, George, which provides the user information on environmental and health risks, based on their location or chosen locations, aggragated by city. </p> <p>Wyatt is George's successor, which includes more personalizations, travel preparation, and a medical diagnostic feature.</p></div>

          <div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #81d4fa">Easier air travel means easier spread of diseases.</div>
          <div class="portfolio-text"><p>The North American traveller market needs a mobile and accessible solution for assisting them with their awareness, preparation, and treatment with regards to travel-related diseases.
            They need a tool that takes them an extra step further than preparation—which should ultimately get them to treatment in case of acquiring an infectious disease, especially while travelling.</p>
            <p>To begin with, factors such as climate, migration of animals and insect vectors are already changing and creating suitable environments for diseases to thrive in—alarmingly, even in environments they were not suitable in before.
            But most importantly, the unprecedented rate of international travel (surpassing 3.5 billion in 2015) parallels the rapid spread and increase of disease-acquisition risk of both old and novel diseases worldwide.</p>
            <p>The ease at which air travel occurs allows for diseases to spread within just a few weeks or days, as observed in the past—makes this a public health concern.</p>
          <p>Wyatt is a travel health mobile app focused on preventing and resolving travel-related infectious diseases through travel preparation and differential diagnosis. Empowering travelers with information about travel-related health risks will help them avoid getting sick and spreading illnesses.</p></div>
          <div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #81d4fa">Google Ventures' Sprint to make the timeline.</div>
          <div class="portfolio-text">Google Ventures' Jake Knapp, Zeratsky, and Kowitz wrote a book in early 2016 about their design sprint process which claims to let you solve and test ideas in five days. This was the perfect process to incorporate in the new design of a consumer mobile app, given the timeline.</div>
          <div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/03/gv-9.jpg');"></div>
          <div class="portfolio-text">Long-term goals, sprint questions, and targets were established on the first day. After conducting a concept map and How Might We exercise with BlueDot's founder, I ended up with this final concept map. In this map arose the obvious targets to work with—the traveller and their research of travel preparations and medical-related conditions.</div>
          <div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/conceptmap.png'); height: 700px; background-size: contain;"></div>
          <div class="portfolio-text">Next, various solutions were ideated and sketched, with competitors in mind for competitive benchmarking and remixing and improving upon existing ideas. These competitors were analyzed beforehand in a comprehensive competitive analysis done for 13 apps and services.</div>
          <div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/competitive-analysis.png');"></div>
          <div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/wyatt-sketch.png'); height: 550px; background-size: contain;"></div>
          <div class="portfolio-text" id="wyatt-final">The two 3-panel sketches above are the two solution alternative the to-be prototyped solution will be picked from. Using a computational decision matrix, the sketch on the left won—and would later be known as <em>Wyatt</em>.</div>


          <div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #81d4fa">High fidelity prototype.</div>
          <div class="portfolio-text"><p>The high fidelity prototype was done in Sketch and Marvel. The final result included a feature of an environmental dashboard (much like a weather app) but showed summaries of concrete actions the user can do or be aware of based on the environmental conditions.</p></div>
          <div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/wyatt-marvel.png');"></div>
          <div class="portfolio-text"><p>Moreover, a travel preparation section was created in order to give the user a more personalized pre-trip experience, while staying aware of any travel health implications their trip may have on them. Lastly, a symptom checker was tested to see how users would react to the chat format of a diagnostic tool, with incorporated keywords for a fake chat feel.</p></div>

          <div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #81d4fa">User research and testing.</div>
          <div class="portfolio-text"><p>As a rule of thumb (or of Nielsen), 5 users are would optimally find 85% of all usability issues. Within BlueDot, 7 people were recruited through an interview screener. These participants were asked to answer 15 minutes worth of contextual ad behavioural questions to validate or invaliate the persona hypotheses, and to gain insights from potential users' behaviours and attitudes towards health and travel. </p></div>
          <div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/wyatt-test.png');"></div>
            <div class="portfolio-text">
            The prototype test was done by asking the user to do two tasks: to get a travel checklist, and to get a potential diagnosis from Wyatt. The results of this study will be held confidential. However, be it known that it led to the iteration of George in a different platform—a chat bot, GeorgeBOT.</div>
