      <p>At BlueDot, we had another existing MVP called GeorgeBOT, which was a Slack chat bot translated from their consumer app on infectious diseases‚ÄîGeorge. Instead of showing risks per city, GeorgeBOT provided diagnoses of tropical infectious diseases. The algorithm existed and was translated into a bot in order for the clinical team to check their database of symptom-disease relationships.</p> <p>GeorgeBOT's new iteration comes from the user testing results found from <a href="/wyatt.html">Wyatt</a>. My role was to iterate on the new design of Wyatt, integrating GeorgeBOT's capabilties, while focusing to create a lightweight consumer "app" on a chat bot platform.</p></div>

    <div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #3fb1fb">mHealth flies solo in the club trying to get your number.</div>
    <div class="portfolio-text"><p>Amongst many apps that have to gather a user's personal information, mHealth has no wingman, no mutuals‚Äîand yet needs the most information in your first meeting.</p><p>Based on the competitive analysis conducted for direct and indirect competitors for medical diagnostic apps and services in <a href="/wyatt.html">Wyatt</a>, integration with the various workflows around getting treatment (such as finding readings on conditions, getting a diagnosis, keeping your records, and connecting you to a doctor), and chat-form diagnoses or doctor Q&As‚Äîwere found to be the best ways to gather data from the user.</p><p>It showed that the more seamless the interaction was with gathering the data from the user about personal matters such as their own health, showed better returns in terms of the users' reactions to how they perceived the quality of the answers they received.</p>

<p>GeorgeBOT was then put back into the surface to be redeveloped. The new vision for GeorgeBOT is to become a healthcare chatbot, with a focus on travel-related infectious diseases. Added to the diagnostic feature are features on news, health services, and travel preparations.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, BlueDot wants to help people achieve the intermediary goal of all things that surpass the 5 whys‚Äîsuch as living a fulfilling life‚Äîwhich is being free of infectious disease, and living a healthy life. </p>

<div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #3fb1fb">A chatbot is better at staying relevant than a mobile app.</div>
<div class="portfolio-text">Google Ventures' Jake Knapp, Zeratsky, and Kowitz wrote a book in early 2016 about their design sprint process which claims to let you solve and test ideas in five days. This was the perfect process to incorporate in the new design of a consumer mobile app, given the timeline.</div>
<div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/03/gv-9.jpg');"></div>
<div class="portfolio-text">Long-term goals, sprint questions, and targets were established on the first day. After conducting a concept map and How Might We exercise with BlueDot's founder, I ended up with this final concept map. In this map arose the obvious targets to work with‚Äîthe traveller and their research of travel preparations and medical-related conditions.</div>
<div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/conceptmap.png'); height: 700px; background-size: contain;"></div>
<div class="portfolio-text">Next, various solutions were ideated and sketched, with competitors in mind for competitive benchmarking and remixing and improving upon existing ideas. These competitors were analyzed beforehand in a comprehensive competitive analysis done for 13 apps and services.</div>
<div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/wyatt-sketch.png'); height: 700px; background-size: contain;"></div>
<div class="portfolio-text" id="wyatt-final">The two 3-panel sketches above are the two solution alternative the to-be prototyped solution will be picked from. Using a computational decision matrix, the sketch on the left won‚Äîand would later be known as <em>Wyatt</em>.</div>


<div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #81d4fa">High fidelity prototype.</div>
<div class="portfolio-text"><p>The high fidelity prototype was done in Sketch and Marvel. The final result included a feature of an environmental dashboard (much like a weather app) but showed summaries of concrete actions the user can do or be aware of based on the environmental conditions.</p></div>
<div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/wyatt-marvel.png');"></div>
<div class="portfolio-text"><p>Moreover, a travel preparation section was created in order to give the user a more personalized pre-trip experience, while staying aware of any travel health implications their trip may have on them. Lastly, a symptom checker was tested to see how users would react to the chat format of a diagnostic tool, with incorporated keywords for a fake chat feel.</p></div>

<div class="portfolio-cap" style="color: #81d4fa">User research and testing.</div>
<div class="portfolio-text"><p>As a rule of thumb (or of Nielsen), 5 users are would optimally find 85% of all usability issues. Within BlueDot, 7 people were recruited through an interview screener. These participants were asked to answer 15 minutes worth of contextual ad behavioural questions to validate or invaliate the persona hypotheses, and to gain insights from potential users' behaviours and attitudes towards health and travel. </p></div>
<div class="portfolio-img" style="background-image:url('images/wyatt/wyatt-test.png');"></div>
  <div class="portfolio-text">
  The prototype test was done by asking the user to do two tasks: to get a travel checklist, and to get a potential diagnosis from Wyatt. The results of this study will be held confidential. However, be it known that it led to the iteration of George in a different platform‚Äîa chat bot, GeorgeBOT.</div><br><br>
